# Active Context: Food24x7

## Current Work Focus
- **Phase 1 COMPLETE:** Backend API Development
- Production-ready Node.js/Express.js API fully implemented
- All core food delivery platform functionality operational
- Comprehensive RESTful endpoints for customer ordering and restaurant management

## Recent Changes
- **MAJOR UPDATE:** Complete backend API implementation finished
- All database models implemented (User, Restaurant, MenuItem, Order)
- Full authentication system with JWT and role-based access control
- Complete middleware layer (auth, validation, error handling, security)
- All API routes and controllers implemented and tested
- Comprehensive API documentation created
- Testing suite implemented with health checks and integration tests
- Production-ready configuration with security features

## Next Steps
1. **Frontend Development (Phase 2):**
   - Web application development with React.js
   - Mobile application development
   - Admin dashboard implementation
2. **Real-time Features:**
   - Socket.io integration for live order tracking
   - Push notifications system
3. **Production Deployment:**
   - Database setup (MongoDB Atlas)
   - Server deployment configuration
   - CI/CD pipeline setup
4. **Advanced Features:**
   - Payment gateway integration
   - Advanced analytics dashboard
   - Email/SMS notification services

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **API-First Approach:** Building backend APIs before frontend
- **Multi-Platform Support:** APIs designed for web and mobile clients
- **Real-time Features:** Socket.io for order tracking
- **Scalable Architecture:** Support for multiple restaurants
- **Security Focus:** JWT authentication, input validation, security middleware

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- RESTful API design with standard HTTP methods
- Middleware-based request processing pipeline
- Schema validation at API layer with Joi
- Centralized error handling
- MVC pattern for code organization
- Real-time notifications for order updates

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Food delivery platform requires complex order management system
- Real-time tracking is critical for user experience
- Multi-tenant architecture needed for restaurant support
- Authentication and authorization crucial for different user roles
- API documentation essential for frontend development
